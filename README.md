A small image gallery project.

TODO
====

* Read the image metadata via imagemagick 
* Pass a proper JSON array to the images route that contains all image data (date, filename, etc.)
* Use backbone / underscore / html to render the images on the index route
* Images should load via infinite scroll
* Variable image layout to keep the look and feel interesting
* Design some sweet masthead
* Break the image loading / rendering stuff out into a plugin
* Documentation for how to set this up in your project in a quick and easy way
